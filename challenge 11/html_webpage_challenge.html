        <article>A Hungarian collector named Attila Fitos first found the fossil in question in the Gerecse Mountains in 1996, and it’s sat in the Hungarian Natural History Museum in Budapest ever since. The research team decided to name the new species preserved in that fossil Magyarosuchus fitosi, in Fitos’s honor. That animal turns out to be an almost 16-foot long behemoth with an incredibly large, pointed snout made for snatching prey, a tail fin to help it swim, and body armor more closely associated with terrestrial reptiles. It’s thought to have been one of the biggest coastal predators of its time.</article>
